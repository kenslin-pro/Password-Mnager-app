# Overview

In my pursuit of advancing my skills as a software engineer, I developed a secure password manager using the Rust programming language. This project aimed to deepen my understanding of Rust's syntax, memory safety features, and overall system-level programming capabilities. The primary goal was to create a functional password manager that demonstrates proficiency in Rust.

# Software Description

The password manager is a command-line application allowing users to securely store and retrieve passwords. It emphasizes data security through robust encryption techniques implemented in Rust. The application showcases features such as password storage, retrieval, and additional security measures, all implemented with a focus on Rust best practices.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project was twofold. Firstly, it served as a practical exercise to apply and solidify my understanding of Rust, a language known for its emphasis on memory safety without sacrificing performance. Secondly, it allowed me to delve into the domain of security-focused application development, understanding how Rust's features can be leveraged to create robust and secure software.

Please watch the demo video for a 4-5 minute walkthrough of the software in action. The video covers the functionality of the password manager and provides insights into the Rust language features used in the code.

# Development Environment


- **Rust Programming Language:** The core language for development.
- **Cargo:** Rust's package manager, used for project dependency management and building.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My primary integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, with Rust-specific extensions for enhanced development.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites invaluable for learning and troubleshooting:

- [Rust Official Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust Programming Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/)

# Future Work

While the current version of the password manager demonstrates fundamental functionality, there are areas for improvement and expansion:

- **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the user experience with a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Extend compatibility to different operating systems.
- **Integration of Advanced Encryption:** Explore and implement more advanced encryption techniques for heightened security.
- **Cross-Device Syncing:** Implement a secure mechanism for syncing passwords across multiple devices.
- **Password Strength Analysis:** Include a feature to assess the strength of stored passwords.
