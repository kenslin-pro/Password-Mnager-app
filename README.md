# Overview

I have developed a secure password manager using the Rust programming language. This project aimed to deepen my understanding of Rust's syntax, memory safety features, and overall system-level programming capabilities. The primary goal was to create a functional password manager that demonstrates proficiency in Rust.

# Software Description

The password manager is a command-line application allowing users to securely store and retrieve passwords. The application showcases features such as password storage, retrieval, and additional security measures, all implemented with a focus on Rust best practices.

# Purpose

There are two purposes for this project. Firstly, it served as a practical exercise to apply and solidify my understanding of Rust, a language known for its emphasis on memory safety without sacrificing performance. Secondly, it allowed me to delve into the domain of security-focused application development, understanding how Rust's features can be leveraged to create robust and secure software.

# Development Environment


- **Rust Programming Language:** The core language for development.
- **Cargo:** Rust's package manager, used for project dependency management and building.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My primary integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, with Rust-specific extensions for enhanced development.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites useful.

- [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/)
- [Rust Programming Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust Official Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)

# Future Work

- **Integration of Advanced Encryption:** Explore and implement more advanced encryption techniques for heightened security.
- **Cross-Device Syncing:** Implement a secure mechanism for syncing passwords across multiple devices.
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the user experience with a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
